This project implements a Hotel Room Reservation System, designed as a web application to efficiently manage room bookings across a multi-floor hotel. The system features 97 rooms distributed over 10 floors: floors 1-9 each have 10 rooms (e.g., 101-110), while the 10th floor has 7 rooms (1001-1007).

The core functionality revolves around an intelligent booking algorithm that prioritizes optimal room assignments. Guests can book up to 5 rooms at a time, with the system first attempting to assign all rooms on the same floor. If insufficient rooms are available on a single floor, the algorithm extends its search across multiple floors, always aiming to minimize the total travel time between the first and last booked room. Travel time calculations are based on defined rules: 1 minute per adjacent room horizontally and 2 minutes per floor vertically using the stairs/lift.

The user interface provides intuitive controls for booking rooms, visualizing hotel occupancy (available, occupied, and newly booked rooms are color-coded), generating random occupancy patterns for testing, and resetting the hotel's state. Developed using React.js for the frontend and styled with CSS, this in-memory system offers a responsive and dynamic user experience, demonstrating robust logic for complex reservation scenarios. The application is designed for easy deployment, showcasing a complete and functional prototype as specified in the assessment.
